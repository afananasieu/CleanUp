# CleanUp
What the Project does?

In this project our key activity is to create an app that connects clients and cleaning employees. We search and contact with avialable employees (cleaners) in different areas to establish an immediate 24h service demanded by 18-25year olds. This project is based on an App that asks the users for their location, when and what type of cleaning service they need and then it offers different options depending on the needs specified by the user. 

Why the Project is useful?

The main utility of this project, is to provide an immediate service to the user. From this immediate service, a link will be made between the demands requested by the user and the available cleaners, matching supply and demand. Once this is done, the main task of this app can be carried out, which is offering an effective service for young people looking to have an immediate cleaning service available to them.

How can users get started with the project?

Users will start using the app because they need the service our company offers, and they are not able to find it anywhere else. You can either be a person in search for a job as a cleaner, or a user that actually needs the cleaning services.
To start, users will be asked to sign in either as a cleaner trying to find job or a person in need of cleaning services. Once they sign in depending on the necessities, they will be sent to two different places inside the web, there they will find the surveys they need to fill to be displayed the necessary information. 

Where users can get help with your project?

The aim of our project is to provide convenience cleaning service to young people. This simple, easy-to-use App would help users to find cleaners easily just by asking simple and fast questions. Where (place at which you are living), when (day and time) and cleaning intensity. 

Who maintains and contribute to the project?

During the process of getting known we are planning on partnering with other well-known cleaning enterprises not only to get the materials needed for providing a good, high quality service but also in order to get promoted.
